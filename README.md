How to use:
1. Download using the .ipa file or the .app file.
2. Create blocks using the "add block" button on the bottom.
3. Drag blocks to rearrange them.
4. Use the settings (gear icon) to show and hide labels, times, and icons. You can also turn on edit mode to change and delete blocks.

The app will be a bit laggy on the first open, sorry about that ;-;
This is the first distribution so it may also be buggy.
